      <p>A word to my readers before they begin these pages.</p>
      <p>
        As a woman of inborn principle and strict Presbyterian training, I hate
        deception and cannot abide subterfuge. This is why, after a year or more
        of hesitation, I have felt myself constrained to put into words the true
        history of the events surrounding the solution of that great mystery
        which made Lost Man's Lane the dread of the neighboring country.
        Feminine delicacy, and a natural shrinking from revealing to the world
        certain weaknesses on my part, inseparable from a true relation of this
        tale, led me to consent to the publication of that meagre and decidedly
        falsified account of the matter which has appeared in some of our
        leading papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        But conscience has regained its sway in my breast, and with all due
        confidence in your forbearance, I herein take my rightful place in these
        annals, of whose interest and importance I now leave you to judge.
